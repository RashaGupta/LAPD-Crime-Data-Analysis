Please note that this project was completed using MySQL Workbench and Python - by integrating the files using PyMySQL library to connect between the two.
The MySQL workbench file changes could not be uploaded onto GitHub, therefore this Python file uploaded is just for reference purposes.
This project is purely on Exploratory Data Analysis and Insights and Strategies for LAPD based on their crime data as of 2019 (around the time when Covid had started).

Many thanks,
Rachana
